## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Chrome browser (required for Selenium)

### Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd email-extractor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install ChromeDriver** (optional):
   - The app uses `webdriver-manager` which automatically downloads the correct ChromeDriver version
   - Ensure Google Chrome is installed on your system

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the Streamlit app in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the App

1. **Enter Search Keywords**: Type the keywords you want to search for
2. **Set Number of Pages**: Use the slider to select how many search result pages to scrape (1-10)
3. **Optional Settings**: 
   - Toggle headless mode to see the browser in action
   - Enable domain filtering to exclude free email providers
4. **Click "Start Searching"**: The app will:
   - Open a browser and perform the Google search
   - Scrape the specified number of pages
   - Extract all email addresses
   - Generate an Excel file
5. **Download Results**: Download as Excel (.xlsx), CSV, or plain text (.txt)

### app.py
Main Streamlit application orchestrating the workflow.

**Features**:
- Interactive UI with sidebar configuration
- Real-time progress tracking
- Session state management
- Multiple download formats
- Responsive error handling
- Comprehensive documentation

## Configuration Options

### Sidebar Settings

**Headless Mode** (Default: ON)
- When enabled: Browser runs invisibly in the background (faster)
- When disabled: See the browser window as it scrapes (slower but helps debugging)

**Exclude Free Email Domains** (Default: OFF)
- When enabled: Filters out gmail.com, yahoo.com, outlook.com, etc.
- Useful for finding business/corporate email addresses

## Performance Tips

1. **Optimal Page Count**: Start with 1-2 pages (10-20 results), increase as needed
2. **Keywords**: More specific keywords yield better results
3. **Delays**: The app includes 2-3 second delays between pages to avoid blocking
4. **Chrome**: Ensure Chrome is fully closed if you encounter driver errors
5. **Network**: Better internet connection = faster scraping

## Troubleshooting

### "No emails found"
- Try different/more specific keywords
- Increase the number of pages to scrape
- Verify the search results contain emails

### "Google is blocking requests"
- Wait 5-10 minutes before retrying
- Reduce the number of pages
- Enable headless mode (helps avoid detection)

### "Chrome driver not found"
- The app auto-downloads ChromeDriver via webdriver-manager
- Ensure you have an active internet connection for the first run
- Verify Chrome browser is installed

### "Browser won't open"
- Check that no other Chrome instances are running
- Try disabling headless mode to see errors
- Restart the application
